# Introduction

Schedule meetings inside of Topia

But in Production, only the Server port will be exposed, and the server will also serve the static React files generated by `npm run build`

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm` in server
- `cd client`
- Run `npm i` in client
- After configuring everything, run `npm start`
